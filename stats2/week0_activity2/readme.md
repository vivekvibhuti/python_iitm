# IMDB Top 250 Movies

### Description
* This folder contains the python file and the output file generated by it.
* I have scraped the IMDB website with _BeautifulSoup_ to get the details of the movies in the list.
* I have further used modules such as _re_, _html5_ to parse the values, then through the code, I used _JSON_ module to convert the dictionary into a json file.
* Then, I used _Pandas_ to convert the json file into an excel file as the final result.

* More than 100  directors have 2 or less movies in the list, with a total of 156 directors credited to the overall list.
