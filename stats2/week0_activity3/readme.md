#  Select an experiment and event, and perform a Monte Carlo Simulation to verify the computed probability.
_(check it from the top  up to the heading "Solution for Large Numbers" and the code cell below it)_

I have used the distribution of prime numbers to answer the question "What is the probability that a randomly chosen integer from 1 to x is a prime number?"
- For small number x, I have used the known list of primes falling in the range from 1 to x. I simulated the probability of randomly choosing a number between 1 and 10 (end points included) and the chosen number being a prime. From computation, it is 40% and Monte Carlo Simulation results in being almost equal to 40%.
- For larger number, I have used The Prime Number Theorem to estimate the number of primes and then computed the probability of randomly choosing a prime number. I used this result, and calculated the probability of randomly choosing a prime number out of the first million numbers to be about 7.23% and then performed the simulation to get the probability estimate by the Monte Carlo Simulation. (Since The Prime Number Theorem is also an estimation, and not the actual answer, there ought to be some minute difference between the answers computed by the theorem and the estimation generated by the simulation.)
- The probabilities computed  manually are similar to the value obtained using Monte Carlo simulation.
